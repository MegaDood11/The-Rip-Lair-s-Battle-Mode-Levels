For usage of this powerup, you will need to utilize 2 things:

- custompowerups.lua (by Marioman2007 and Emral)
- The Rip Lair Powerup Pack (contains the fixed version of it)

Follow the instructions on how to use them and just drag and drop your player assets and replace
the existing Luigi ones with these in your episode's costume folder or whatever you might use it for!
