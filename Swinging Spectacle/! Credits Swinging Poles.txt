Swinging Poles (and the cool anglerfish guy) made by "Master" of Disaster

I'm pretty happy with how this turned out, so don't make me sad by selling it as your own

All 5 vanilla characters are fully supported!

changelog v1.1:
- Added multiplayer support
- changed naming convention for swinging spritesheet ([character index]-[costume name, all caps]-on-pole.png)
- if no spritesheet for a character costume is found, it uses a sprite from the normal spritesheet instead
- you can now customize how much you accelerate when swinging. Default is a little higher than before
- when swinging on a pole, you now show the starman effect and I-frame blinking
